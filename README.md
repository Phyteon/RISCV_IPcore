# RISC-V IP Core project
This repository is used in development of soft processor based on RISC-V ISA. It's my B.E. thesis,
as well as private venture into the FPGA world.

# What is the intention of this project?
The main objective I hope to achieve is to create a simple, low-cost (resource-wise) processor
that can be used to educate people about CPU design, FPGA and HDLs. If possible, I would want to
bring my processor onto low-cost FPGA along with IP core debugger to be able to program it using one 
programmer (ideally via onboard one). This is a challenge also for me, so if You come across this
repository, then don't expect ultra high-end stuff here.

# Why RISC-V?
Well, there are several reasons:
- it's an open-ISA standard, which helps a lot a beginner like me
- more and more industry relevant companies are interested in RISC-V development
